        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Vera Pham and I am currently a second year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. Currently, I am pursuing a bachelors in accounting and have two more years of studying until my graduation date. I enjoy journaling and listening to music in my free time. Recently, I have been listening to a lot of CCM and jazz. I have two family pets, one is a shiba inu and the other is a husky/poodle mix. Our shiba inuâ€™s name is Mika and she is shy around strangers. She likes to sleep a lot and go on walks. Our husky/poodle mix is named Cooper and he is very outgoing around strangers. He does not bite but he has lots of youthful energy and loves to play with people. Although they may seem very different from each other, they balance one another out well. I believe I keep to myself more but enjoy taking walks outside because it is relaxing for me. At the moment, I am involved in this Christian fellowship on campus called Asian American Christian Fellowship. It has been a very enjoyable experience so far and I am thankful to have a community of sisters and brothers to encourage one another in our walks with Him. As a college student, there are lots of responsibilities and personal events, but glory to God for allowing me to run to Him as my fortress and deliverer. Those are some personal facts about me, if there is any more you would like to speak about feel free to contact me. Going forward, although I have not had any professional experience inclusive to accounting yet, here are some of my leadership involvements and other work exposures.<br><br>

        I have worked as an inventory clerk at Hirel Connectors, an engineering company focused on manufacturing parts for the governmentsâ€™ space programs. It is based in Claremont and has its own labs and warehouses. Through working here, I have honed my organization and communication skills. On a daily basis, I recorded over 2,000 lines of items and carefully cleaned the manufacturing parts. The environment is very friendly and professional, and I would recommend working there if you need a starting engineering job. The company is still running and looking for new inventory clerks.<br><br>

        Lastly, I am leading as a musical group leader at Belvedere Alliance Church. It has been a little over two years and through this experience, it has helped me learn the importance of what it means to be a leader and a good listener. Every three weeks, I carefully compile a list of worship songs for that Sunday and spend a few hours practicing the songs with my team. It has been a humbling experience and joy being able to fellowship with my sisters and brothers in Christ and praise the Lord for who He is. The instruments I play include the guitar, keyboard and vocals. This experience has also helped me grow in faith and perseverance, because I have been serving for over a few years. Thank you for taking the time to read through this portfolio! If you have any questions, comments or concerns, feel free to contact me.
